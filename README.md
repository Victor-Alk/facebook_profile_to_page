Transforming Facebook Profiles into Page Link

This Python script automates the process of transforming Facebook profile links into their corresponding Facebook page URLs using Selenium and Pandas. The script reads a CSV file containing the profile links, visits each link, and captures any redirects to the proper Facebook page. It handles cookie prompts and saves the updated URLs to a new CSV file.

Key Features:

1. Automates Browser Interactions: Utilizes Selenium WebDriver to automate the process of visiting Facebook profile links.
2. Handles Cookie Prompts: Automatically accepts Facebook's cookie prompts to ensure smooth navigation.
3. Captures Redirects: Identifies and records any redirects from the profile link to the proper Facebook page URL.
4. Saves Updated Links: Outputs the transformed page URLs into a new CSV file for easy access and further analysis.

This tool is particularly useful for scenarios where Facebook profile links may redirect to official Facebook pages, ensuring that you always have the most accurate and up-to-date URLs.
